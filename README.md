# ðŸš€ OpenAI Search Scripts

A small Python sample project that demonstrates how to use the OpenAI Chat Completions API by taking a search phrase from the user, sending it to the API, and returning a JSON response.
This repo contains **two scripts**:

1. **`openai_search_minimal.py`** â€“ the internship deliverable âœ…  
   - Accepts a phrase as input  
   - Calls OpenAI Chat Completions API  
   - Prints the result as well-formatted JSON  

2. **`openai_search_cli.py`** â€“ an upgraded CLI version ðŸŽ¨  
   - Same JSON output as above  
   - Adds a styled Rich panel in the terminal  
   - Shows **tokens used (this query)** and **running total**  
   - Persists total tokens across runs (`token_log.json`)
